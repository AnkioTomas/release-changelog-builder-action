### What's included üöÄ

- Super simple integration
  - ...even on huge repositories with hundreds of tags
- Parallel releases support
- Blazingly fast execution
- Supports any git project
- Highly flexible configuration
- Lightweight
- Supports any branch
- Rich build log output

-------

## Setup

### Configure the workflow

Specify the action as part of your GitHub actions workflow:

```yml
- name: "Build Changelog"
  id: build_changelog
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

By default the action will try to automatically retrieve the `tag` from the current commit and automtacally resolve the `tag` before. Read more about this here.

### Action outputs

After action execution it will return the `changelog` and additional information as step output. You can use it in any follow up step by referenceing the output by referencing it via the steps id. For example `build_changelog`.

```yml
# ${{steps.{CHANGELOG_STEP_ID}.outputs.changelog}}
${{steps.build_changelog.outputs.changelog}}
```

A full set list of possible output values for this action.

| **Output**          | **Description**                                                                                                           |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `outputs.changelog` | The built release changelog built from the merged pull requests                                                           |
| `outputs.owner`     | Specifies the owner of the repository processed                                                                           |
| `outputs.repo`      | Describes the repository name, which was processed                                                                        |
| `outputs.fromTag`   | Defines the `fromTag` which describes the lower bound to process pull requests for                                        |
| `outputs.toTag`     | Defines the `toTag` which describes the upper bound to process pull request for                                           |
| `outputs.failed`    | Defines if there was an issue with the action run, and the changelog may not have been generated correctly. [true, false] |

## Customization üñçÔ∏è

### Changelog Configuration

The action supports flexible configuration options to modify vast areas of its behavior. To do so, provide the configuration file to the workflow using the `configuration` setting.

```yml
- name: "Build Changelog"
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
  with:
    configuration: "configuration.json"
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This configuration is a `.json` file in the following format.

```json
{
    "categories": [
        {
            "title": "## üöÄ Features",
            "labels": ["feature"]
        },
        {
            "title": "## üêõ Fixes",
            "labels": ["fix"]
        },
        {
            "title": "## üß™ Tests",
            "labels": ["test"]
        }
    ],
    "sort": "ASC",
    "template": "${{CHANGELOG}}\n\n<details>\n<summary>Uncategorized</summary>\n\n${{UNCATEGORIZED}}\n</details>",
    "pr_template": "- ${{TITLE}}\n   - PR: #${{NUMBER}}",
    "empty_template": "- no changes",
    "transformers": [
        {
            "pattern": "[\\-\\*] (\\[(...|TEST|CI|SKIP)\\])( )?(.+?)\n(.+?[\\-\\*] )(.+)",
            "target": "- $4\n  - $6"
        }
    ],
    "max_tags_to_fetch": 200,
    "max_pull_requests": 200,
    "max_back_track_time_days": 90,
    "exclude_merge_branches": [
        "Owner/qa"
    ]
}
```

Any section of the configruation can be ommited to have defaults apply.
Defaults for the configuraiton can be found in the [configuration.ts](https://github.com/mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action/blob/develop/src/configuration.ts)


### Advanced workflow specification

For advanced usecases additional settings can be provided to the action

```yml
- name: "Complex Configuration"

  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@{latest-release}
  with:
    configuration: "configuration_complex.json"
    owner: "mikepenz"
    repo: "release-changelog-builder-action"
    ignorePreReleases: "false"
    fromTag: "0.0.2"
    toTag: "0.0.3"

| failOnError       | Defines if the action will result in a build failure, if problems occurred. Default: false                                                                               |

## Complete Sample üñ•Ô∏è

Below is a complete example showcasing how to define a build, which is executed when tagging the project. It consists of:
- Prepare tag, via the GITHUB_REF environment variable
- Build changelog, given the tag
- Create release on GitHub - specifying body with constructed changelog
 
```yml
name: 'CI'
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - '*'

  release:
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build Changelog
        id: github_release
        uses: mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Create Release
        uses: actions/create-release@v1
        with:
          tag_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          release_name: ${{ github.ref }}
          body: ${{steps.github_release.outputs.changelog}}
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Contribute üß¨

```bash
# Install the dependencies  
$ npm install

# Build the typescript and package it for distribution
$ npm run build && npm run package

# Run the tests, use to debug, and test it out
$ npm test

# Verify lint is happy
$ npm run lint -- --fix
```

It's suggested to export the token to your path before running the tests, so that API calls can be done to github.

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_github_pat
```
